        <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very 
            welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and accessible 
            to the whole community. You can also support us by donating items of interest 
            to the museum’s collections.
            If you have some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let 
            us know by contacting our Collections Department and they will be able 
            to assist you.</p>

            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <figcaption>A number of people volunteer their 
                time and effort to keep the displays in 
                good order and ready for visitors to 
                come and enjoy. Volunteering has its 
                perks including getting to see behind 
                the scenes of a working museum, 
                access to staff-only lectures, and a 
                monthly lunch where all staff and 
                volunteers come together to discuss 
                ideas for future exhibits and strategies 
                for the museum. You can help volunteer 
                in a number of different spheres. 
                Please contact us if you’d like to find out 
                more about how you can get involved.</figcaption>

            <h2>Internship</h2>
            <figcaption>Are you interested in working in a museum? 
                Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of 
                sharing the wonders of nature with people? 
                Well you could be just the right person to 
                enjoy an internship at the museum.
                You’ll be learning from a number of different 
                academics and people who are passionate 
                about science and sharing it with the 
                wider community.
