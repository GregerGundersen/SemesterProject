                <h2>Cosmology</h2>
                <figcaption>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. 
                    Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky 
                    Above Us’, explores the night sky and 
                    what we can see and know about the 
                    universe around us. 
                    We’ll locate the various constellations 
                    and galaxies that can be seen and 
                    learn a bit about the early navigators 
                    who used the stars to travel by.
    
                    Follow the journey of our solar 
    exploration: from early Arab traders, 
    to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest 
    exploration of the planets in our 
    solar system.</figcaption>

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <figcaption>For centuries, philosophers and scientists 
                    have wrestled with the question of our 
                    origins. Where do we come from and how 
                    did we get here? 
                    Since Darwin proposed his theory of 
                    evolution we have had a framework for 
                    exploring and understanding our place 
                    in this world.Discover the origins of life on this planet 
                    and how the species we know today have 
                    evolved our time. 
                    You can also take some time to meet a 
                    few of the creatures who didn’t survive, 
                    including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, 
                    and a number of dinosaurs too.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>The information revolution is here and 
                    robotics and artificial intelligence are the 
                    science of the future. 
                    From useful home applications of AI to 
                    industrial uses of robotics, the future 
                    is here. You can even say hello and shake 
                    the hand of Rob the Robot.</figcaption>

                <h2>Ecology</h2>
                <figcaption>As we learn more and more of the impact 
                    humans are having on the planet, the more 
                    important it becomes that scientists explore 
                    how to create a sustainable future not just 
                    for humans but for the whole planet.
                    
                    In our ecology section of the museum, we 
                    unpack the dangers we currently face 
                    including global warming, extinction of 
                    species, and pollution. But we also focus on 
                    the positive ways we can all contribute to 
                    a brighter future.</figcaption>
